# node-service
Node based UniFi guest portal

## Get started

To start the template service simple run the following commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To run it in development with `Nodemon` just invoke

```bash
npm run nodemon
```

For a proper working application you need to set the following environment variables.
It's easier to create an `.env` file based on the `.env.list` in this repository.

## Additional notes

The front-end code resides in an create-react-app based git repo, which is currently
not published... which shoudl follow soon.

Also any tests are currently missing. The code base is just an experiment so far.
